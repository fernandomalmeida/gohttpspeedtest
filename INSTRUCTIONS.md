# Assignment

## Description
Create a small GO library that tests the download and upload speeds by using Ookla's https://www.speedtest.net/ and Netflix's https://fast.com/.

## Requirements

1. The library has 1 exposed API, that starts the speed test by providing the choice between the 2 speed providers(Ookla's & Netflix's) and returns the Mbps for both download and upload
2. The test coverage for the implementation has to be at least 80%
3. Provide 2 benchmark tests (1 for each of the 2, Ookla's & Netflix's) for the exposed API
4. Provide documentation for your implementation, both via code docs and README.md

## Evaluation

We look for:
1. The way you structure your code
2. The code quality (code standards, best practices, design patterns, etc)
3. The way you write tests
4. The way you write docs
5. Attention to details

## Suggestions

Please don't reinvent the wheel. The internet has everything you need. We care about how you solve puzzles and how you use the legos to build the end product.

You can use whichever 3rd party libraries you see fit to get the job done.
